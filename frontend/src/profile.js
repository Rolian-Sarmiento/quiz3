    description: "Victims of the war on drugs and human rights groups celebrate the International Criminal Court (ICC) Appeals Chamber’s decision denying former President Rodrigo Duterte’s interim release on November 28. Gathering at the University of the Philippines Law Center in Quezon City, members of KARAPATAN, Rise Up for Life and for Rights, and National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) cheered as the Appeals Chamber confirmed that Duterte will remain behind bars. In a statement, Rise Up for Life and for Rights said that the families of drug-related killings are happy with the decision, adding that Duterte’s continuing detention minimizes risks to their safety and security. ''Ngayon ngang nakakulong siya ay patuloy ang harassment na nararanasan namin at ng aming mga taga-suporta mula sa DDS supporters. Nagpapakalat sila ng mga pekeng impormasyon, binabansagan kaming sinungaling, pamilya ng mga adik at kung ano-ano pang masasakit na salita,'' said Nanay Dahlia, relative of a victim. ",

    description: "The Golden Guardians dominated Manuel L. Quezon University (MLQU) Stallions, 67 – 54, in the final elimination round of the 23rd National Athletic Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (NAASCU) at the Immaculate Heart (IH) Gymnasium, November 26. After a back-and-forth opening that saw the teams deadlocked at 5-5, Golden Guardians seized control behind team captain Louise Lagman’s consecutive three-pointers and steady contributions from Semaco Sacmar. Carl Timbol ignited the surge with a precise overhead pass to Brod Wilson Soriano, who glided in for a clean sky play that pushed the lead to 15 – 7. Refusing to fold, the MLQU Stallions chipped away with an offensive rebound and a free throw that carved the deficit down to three in the last two minutes, though the Golden Guardians managed to hold the line — first quarter closed with the hosts up 17 – 14. The Golden Guardians extended their advantage in the second quarter, Charles Ajie and JL De Guzman, together with Joren Gegante and Soriano, scored an eight-point run, 25 – 14,  in four and a half minutes while the opposing team failed to score. However, the visiting team narrowed the gap to eight points in an attempt to catch the homecourt kings, but the Golden Guardians held firm and maintained a seven-point lead, 37 – 30. Pushing to seize the lead in the third quarter, the Stallions stayed within striking distance of the HAU squad at 39 – 37 midway through the half, but the Kapampangan players refused to yield any ground.
